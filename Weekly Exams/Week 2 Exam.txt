Question 2: What is one way to change the Java version for your Maven project?
1. Java Compiler Plugin
2. None of these.
3. Maven compiler plugin.
4. Maven Java plugin.

My Answer: 2
Reason: The only way to change the Java version for a Maven project in VS Code from what is
        shown in class is to update the pom.xml target and source tags, which is not tied to any plugin.

Which of the following is not a variable scope in Java?
1. Global
2. Class
3. Block
4. Instance

My Answer: 4
Reason: Arbitrarily chosen for lack of correct answer, since Java contains all of these.
        Global: Variables that are accessible throughout the entirety of a project. Created using the static keyword in Java.
        Class: Variables that are accessible throughout a class instance's (object's) lifespan. Created by declaring a non-static class field in Java.
        Block: Variables that are accessible throughout a block's lifespan. Created by declaring a variable within said block in Java.
        Instance: Variables that are accessible throughout a class instance's (object's) lifespan. Created by declaring a non-static class field in Java.

The ability of an object to hide its data and methods from other components within the application.
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

My Answer: 1
Reason: Abstraction deals with making programming less complex by hiding implementation wihtin classes and methods.
        Another possible answer could be encapsulation, which deals with promoting loose coupling and high cohesion by
        having classes contain all data and behavior necessary for operation within themselves.
        Due to the question focusing on the object hiding the data and methods from other classes, this
        aligns more with abstraction than encapsulation.
